Safety is generally moderate (Index: 52.8), and while English proficiency is moderate (535), the rich social fabric and \"dolce vita\" lifestyle continue to make it a top choice for retirees seeking European charm.","englishProficiencyScore":535,"expatCommunitySize":2430339,"expenses":{"single":{"amount":1005.8,"currency":"USD"},"family":{"amount":3594.2,"currency":"USD"}},"fragileStatesIndex":41.1,"groceriesIndex":59.5,"healthExpenditurePerCapita":{"amount":3349.6,"currency":"USD"},"healthcareQualityIndex":64.9,"housing":{"rent":{"min":{"amount":650.97,"currency":"USD"},"max":{"amount":1500,"currency":"USD"}},"buy":{"min":{"amount":2492.26,"currency":"USD"},"max":{"amount":4041.41,"currency":"USD"}}},"id":"italy","image":"/images/destinations/italy.jpg","languages":[{"name":"Italian","percentage":0.9},{"name":"English","percentage":0.48},{"name":"French","percentage":0.29},{"name":"Spanish","percentage":0.11}],"officialLanguage":"Italian","population":62007540,"religions":[{"name":"Christianity","percentage":0.7577},{"name":"Islam","percentage":0.0463},{"name":"Jews","percentage":0.0004},{"name":"Non-Religious","percentage":0.1869}],"restaurantIndex":57.4,"safetyIndex":52.8,"taxes":[{"name":"Personal Income Tax (IRPEF)","rate":"23% - 43%"},{"name":"Value-Added Tax (VAT/IVA)","rate":"22%"},{"name":"Property Transfer Tax","rate":"0.1% - 1.06%"},{"name":"Property Tax","rate":"0.5% - 1.06%"},{"name":"Capital Gain","rate":"26%"}],"temperature":{"avg":12.45,"max":12.1,"min":3.3},"visas":[{"name":"Temporary Visa (Short-Stay Tourist/Business)","duration":"3 months","description":"Entry for short visits to Italy (tourism or business) for up to 90 days; no visa needed for North Americans per the page.
