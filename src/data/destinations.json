Cities like Brisbane and Melbourne offer culture and amenities. However, costs are very high, and residency is extremely difficult for retirees without family ties. The country's remote location means long-distance travel to elsewhere. Australia suits those with existing citizenship or family sponsorship seeking English-speaking stability, outdoor lifestyle, and don't mind high costs and distance from other continents.",
